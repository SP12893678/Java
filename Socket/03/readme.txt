From: 
http://www.caterpillar.onlyfun.net/phpBB2/

Usage: 
1. Type the following command to launch the server program.
     java -jar ChatYouAndMeServer.jar

   Type the following command to launch the client program.
     java -jar ChatYouAndMeClient.jar

2. If you are running the server program, provide your nickname and "Lucky Number". But what is the "Lucky Number"? Ha, it's just the necessary TCP port number.
   If you are running the client program, provide your nickname, your target address and "Lucky Number".
   Of course, both of your "Lucky Number" must be the same :)

You could just double-click on the jar file to launch the program if you are using Windows.

This program is written just for fun.
